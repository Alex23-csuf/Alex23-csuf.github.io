## My favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 12, Part 1

  This lab was my favorite because I enjoyed writing the code and working with my partner. 
  It was fun to create images with code and see how much code is required to make a gif or a plain image. 
  It was also interesting to learn the RGB color numbers and which numbers we need to plug in order to make a specific color. 
  It was also fun to be able to create a gif from scratch.

* Lab 7, Part 1

  I enjoyed this lab because it was fun to create a program that allows someone to see where and if they can park at a particular location. 
  If they could not park at a place, they could park somewhere else where the program said it was okay to park. 
  Testing the program in the terminal was also fun, as was seeing if it would work and providing the correct answer to see if someone would park there.

* Lab 5, Part 1

  This lab was my favorite because I enjoyed writing the code and working with my partner. 
  It was a fun lab and to be able to find the length and width of a rectangle. 
  It was also nice to see the numbers we would plug in into the terminal and get the answer that was needed. 
  Every time we tested numbers, the program gave us the correct answer we needed.
